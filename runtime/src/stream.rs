//! Collection of traits for retrieving and manipulating a stream. They are used by implementation of parsing expressions.
//!
//! A stream produces a sequence of items (characters, bytes, etc.) while retaining information on the underlying data traversed. For example, a couple `(File, Iterator<char>)` could represent a stream of characters from a file.

/// Transforms a value into a stream of type `Output`.
pub trait Stream
{
  type Output;
  fn stream(self) -> Self::Output;
}

/// Produces a textual representation of the current position in the stream. For example, it can be `2:5` if the position is at line 2 and column 5.
pub trait Location
{
  fn location(&self) -> String;
}

/// Produces a code snippet of size `len_hint` or less starting from the current position in the stream.
pub trait CodeSnippet
{
  fn code_snippet(&self, len_hint: usize) -> String;
}

/// Consumes `prefix` if it fully matches from the current position in the stream. If it does not match, the stream is not altered and `false` is returned.
pub trait ConsumePrefix<P>
{
  fn consume_prefix(&mut self, prefix: P) -> bool;
}

/// Returns `true` if an item can be read from the stream with `Iterator::next`.
pub trait HasNext
{
  fn has_next(&self) -> bool;
}

pub trait StreamSpan
{
  type Output;
  fn stream_span(&self) -> Self::Output;
}
