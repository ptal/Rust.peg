# Type Inference

A key idea behind Oak is to infer the type of the AST generated by parsing expression.
For example, we expect `e1 e2` to have the type `(T1, T2)` if `e1` has type `T1` and `e2` has type `T2`.
Indeed, it exists an obvious mapping between PEG combinators and traditional types found in programming language: choice is a sum type, sequence is a tuple, repetition is an array, etc.
Oak was born to explore this mapping and to answer a question: can we automatically generate an AST from a grammar description?

It turned out that generating the AST (data type included) was hard, mostly because we need to _name_ types and that rules does not give enough information by themselvesâ€”how to name the variants of the sum type?
Of course, we could annotate expressions with names but it would burden the grammar, and it is unconvenient to have an AST that is hidden.
Also, the user will certainly want to use its own custom types and not arbitrary generated types, so a fully automatic generation is not such a good idea after all.
Therefore, Oak relies on the return types of semantic actions and type annotation to have a complete type inference scheme.
This technique has at least two advantages over conventional methods:

* A closer mapping between grammar and user-code.
For example `number "+" number > add` is a valid expression where `add` is a semantic action called with two arguments of the type of `number`.
* Types are used to generate more efficient code.
Indeed, a value is only built if it is useful somewhere.
For example the generated code of `!number` will only recognize the expression `number` but semantic actions inside `number` will not be called.

This chapter explains how Oak gives type to expression and how you can efficiently control and use it.

### Type annotation

Despite the apparent simplicity of this idea, a direct mapping between expression and type is not very useful. Consider the following grammar for parsing variable identifier.

```
var_ident = !["0-9"] ["a-zA-Z0-9_"]+ spacing
spacing = [" \n\r\t"]*
```

A straightforward mapping would give to this expression the type `(char, Vec<char>, Vec<char>)` since the sequence has three sub expressions and thus forms a 3-tuple. Clearly, the only value of interest in `var_ident` is the one returned by the expression `["a-zA-Z0-9_"]+` which has type `Vec<char>` (note that we could use a semantic action to transform this value into a string). It is natural to think that the rule `var_ident` will be of type `Vec<char>` too. Oak infers this type if we tell him that we do not care about the value of spaces which is not something that it can guess by itself. We use the combinator `e -> (^)` to inform to Oak that we do not want the value of `e` to appear in the AST. There is two possible types: _unit type_ `()` and _invisible type_ `(^)`, they both give the type unit to expressions but, in addition, `(^)` propagates in the expression tree.

```
var_ident = !["0-9"] ["a-zA-Z0-9_"]+ spacing
spacing = [" \n\r\t"]* -> (^)
```

The new type of `var_ident` is now `(char, Vec<char>, (^))`. The inference algorithm automatically reduces this type to `Vec<char>` thanks to a few simplification rules:

* Everything under a syntactic predicate (`!e` or `?e`) has type `(^)`. The new type is `((^), Vec<char>, (^))`.
* Any unit type inside a tuple is removed. We now have `(Vec<char>)`.
* Type inside a 1-tuple is extracted. We finally obtain `Vec<char>`.

These _type rewriting rules_ are intuitive because they produce the type the user expects! Type annotation is only needed to specify that we are not interested by the value, such as with spaces.

### Unit propagation

A type containing a unit type is simplified if it does not erase a piece of information. If we consider the following grammar which describe the optional presence of the `mut` keyword on the left-hand side of a let-expression, the `mut_kw?` type is not rewritten into `()`.

```
let_left = let_kw mut_kw? var_ident
let_kw = "let" spacing
mut_kw = "mut" spacing -> ()
```

We annotated `mut_kw` with `-> ()` otherwise the expression would have the _invisible type_ since literal string and, here spacing, have the type `(^)`.
Therefore, the type of the expression `mut_kw?` is `Option<()>` which is expected since the type `Option<()>` carries a boolean information. As a rule of thumb, unit inference never erase a potential piece of information. In some cases, expression are only of a pure syntactic interest such as spaces or the first optional `|` in OCaml pattern-matching. This is why we use the "invisible type" annotation `e -> (^)` to indicate that the unit type must be propagated up since it does not carry any relevant semantic information.

```
match_expr = match_kw expr with_kw bar? cases
cases = case (bar case)*
bar = "|" spacing
```

In `match_expr`, the expression `bar?` have by default the type `(^)`. The circumflex symbol in `(^)` indicates a bottom up propagation of unit in expressions. The propagation is only stopped if it is composed with a value of a relevant type. For example, the expression `bar? expr` has type `Expr` because `(^)` has been propagated across `Option<(^)>` and then stopped by the tuple `((^), Expr)`.

### Recursive type

We must distinguish recursive rules that are totally valid in Oak and recursive types that can not be automatically inferred. For example, the following grammar accepts strings in which any character at position `i` is 'a' or 'b' if `i` is even and is otherwise 'c' or 'd'.

```
ab = ["ab"] cd?
cd = ["cd"] ab?
```

This is a totally valid grammar but it can not be typed without recursive types. Let's try anyway. Say that `ab` has type `T` and `cd` has type `U`. We can infer that `T = (char, Option<U>)` for rule `ab` and `U = (char, Option<T>)` for rule `cd`. By substitution we get `T = (char, Option<(char, Option<T>))` and thus `T` is defined by itself. It is a recursive type definition. You might think that this type is fine as long as we give an alias to the tuple types:

```rust
type T = (char, Option<U>);
type U = (char, Option<T>);
```

However, the names `T` and `U` are completely arbitrary and the user probably do not want types with random names. We would need name-annotations on expressions which is not our leitmotiv in the first place. It is cleaner and easier to let the user constructs the types by himself with semantic actions.

Nevertheless, we did not want to reject valid grammar because of recursive types. We have chosen to print a warning during compilation informing we reduced the types of rules involved in a type cycle to `(^)`. You can get rid of this warning by explicitly annotating one the rule in the cycle with `-> (^)`.
