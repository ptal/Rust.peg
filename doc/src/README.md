# The Oak Parser Generator

Hello! Oak is a parser generator based on [_Parsing Expression Grammar_ (PEG)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parsing_expression_grammar).
This project has been started to explore the idea of automatically inferring the types of the AST generated by parsing expressions.
It is written as a procedural macro and can be embedded in your Rust code without complicating the build system.

Independently of your programming experience with parser generators, a first step is to read the [Getting Started](getting-started.md) chapter.
If you are new to parser generator or PEG, the chapter [Learn Oak](learn-oak.md) is a smooth tutorial to Oak for incrementally building a small language named `Calc` with arithmetic expressions and variable bindings.
You can directly dive into the full grammar of `Calc` in the chapter [Full Calc Grammar](full-calc-grammar.md).
If you want to learn about the Oak specificities, please go to the chapter [Typing Expression](typing-expression.md).
Finally, in the chapter [Related Work](related-work.md), we compare Oak to existing parser generators and give some references and credits to papers or implementations that inspired the design of Oak.

The code is available on [github](https://github.com/ptal/oak).

### Syntax cheat sheet

`e` is a sub expression and `T` is the type of `e`.
The types are only informative, it does not show unit propagation, more on that in [Typing Expression](typing-expression.md).
Greedy operators do not generate "backtracking points" and consume as many characters as possible.

| Item            | Type                  | Description |
| --------------- | --------------------- | ----------- |
| `r = e`         | Type of `e`           | Declare a rule named `r` parsing the expression `e`. |
| `r: T = e`      | `T`                   | Declare a rule named `r` of type `T` parsing the expression `e`. |



| Expression      | Type                  | Precedence level | Description |
| --------------- | --------------------- |----------------- | ----------- |
| `"literal"`     | `(^)`                 | 0                | Match a string literal. |
| `.`             | `char`                | 0                | Match any single character. |
| `["a-zA-Z-"]`   | `char`                | 0                | Match a character from one of the specified classes. |
| `(e)`           | `T`                   | 0                | Group an expression. |
| `rule`          | Type of `rule`        | 0                | Call the rule with the name `rule`. |
| `ident`         | `_`                   | 0                | Call an external parser with the name `parse_ident` and `recognize_ident` depending on the context. |
| `..`            | `StreamSpan::Output`  | 0                | Create the location information (span) of the expression following `..`|
| `e?`            | `Option<T>`           | 1                | (Greedy) Match zero or one `e`. Always succeed. |
| `e*`            | `Vec<T>`              | 1                | (Greedy) Match zero or more `e`. Always succeed. |
| `e+`            | `Vec<T>`              | 1                | (Greedy) Match one or more `e`. |
| `&e`            | `(^)`                 | 2                | Try to match `e` and succeed if `e` succeeds. It does not consume any input. |
| `!e`            | `(^)`                 | 2                | Try to match `e` and succeed if `e` fails. It does not consume any input. |
| `e1 e2 e3`      | `(T1, T2, T3)`        | 3                | Match `e1 e2 e3` in sequence. Immediately fails when one fails. |
| `e > f`         | Return type of `f`    | 4                | Match `e` and if it succeeds, call `f(v)` where `v` is the value of `e`. |
| `e: ()`         | `()`                  | 4                | Force the type of `e` to be `()`. |
| `e: (^)`        | `(^)`                 | 4                | Force the type of `e` to be `(^)`. |
| `e: T`          | `T`                   | 4                | Force the type of `e` to be a Rust type `T`. |
| `e1 / e2 / e3`  | Type of any `e`       | 5                | Match `e1 e2 e3` in sequence. Immediately succeeds when one succeeds. |

### Oak status

My goal is to propose a complete library to ease the development of *Embedded Domain Specific Language* (EDSL) in Rust with procedural macros.
For the moment my priority is to stabilize and test Oak.
Next I want to add more static analysis to prevent grammar design error such as in `"=" / "=="` (can you find what is wrong?)
Here some other wanted features:

* Extend the choice operator to handle erroneous cases ([#30](https://github.com/ptal/oak/issues/30)).
* Bootstrap the grammar ([#42](https://github.com/ptal/oak/issues/42)).
* Parametrize rules with other rules and arguments ([#10](https://github.com/ptal/oak/issues/10), [#12](https://github.com/ptal/oak/issues/12), [#28](https://github.com/ptal/oak/issues/28)).
