# Contributing

A library writer always has the secret hope that its library will be used by thousands. An even more secret hope is that some users would become *contributors*!

If you want to contribute, please contact me by email (ptalbot@hyc.io) to discuss about a project suited to your ambitions and needs.
I'm willing to mentor you until you feel confident with the code and I'm opened to suggestions :-)
